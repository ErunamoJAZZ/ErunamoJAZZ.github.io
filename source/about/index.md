# Hello there

I am Daniel from Medellín in Colombia. I am software developer, not a good gamer, and not a coffee addict (or anything), sorry :P

I attended at the National University of Colombia, and I like Functional Programming a lot (but I'm not a _pro_ with that).

I was part of YC Fellowship 2 with **Ctzen**, a platform to make better cities.

In this blog you will find some post about many stuff in spanish and in my basic english.

**Welcome to my simple blog.**
